# XSS Lab - Educational Web Application

A full-stack web application that serves as an educational lab for demonstrating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities and their secure mitigations. This project is designed to help developers understand different types of XSS attacks and learn how to prevent them.

## Features

- Several levels of XSS vulnerabilities and their secure implementations:
  1. Reflected XSS
  2. Stored XSS
  3. JavaScript Attribute Injection
  4. DOM-Based XSS
  5. XSS via `eval()`
  6. DOM-Based XSS via JavaScript Context
- Side-by-side comparison of vulnerable and secure code
- Interactive examples with payload suggestions
- Educational explanations and best practices
- Modern, responsive UI using Bootstrap

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

## Setup and Installation

To set up this project from scratch or to run it after cloning:

1.  **Clone the repository (if not already done):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yamneg96/repo-name.git
    cd vulnerableVSsecure
    ```* 

2.  **Initialize the Node.js project (if starting from scratch):**
    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```
    *This command creates a `package.json` file.*

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install express ejs body-parser express-session sanitize-html nodemon
    ```
    *Alternatively, if `package.json` already exists, simply run `npm install`.*

4.  **Start the application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5.  **Open your browser and navigate to:**
    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

## Security Warning

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This application is intentionally vulnerable to XSS attacks for educational purposes. The vulnerable versions are designed to demonstrate security risks. Never implement these vulnerable patterns in production code.

## Learning Objectives

1.  **Reflected XSS**
    - Understanding how user input can be reflected in the page
    - Learning to use `textContent` instead of `innerHTML`
    - Implementing proper input sanitization

2.  **Stored XSS**
    - Understanding persistent XSS attacks
    - Learning to escape HTML content
    - Implementing proper data sanitization

3.  **JavaScript Attribute Injection**
    - Understanding JavaScript injection vulnerabilities
    - Learning input validation and type checking
    - Implementing secure event handling

4.  **DOM-Based XSS**
    - See how client-side JavaScript can create XSS vulnerabilities without server interaction.

5.  **XSS via `eval()`**
    - Understand the dangers of using `eval()` with untrusted user input.

6.  **DOM-Based XSS via JavaScript Context (Follow the Rabbit)**
    - Exploit DOM-based XSS where the payload is injected directly into JavaScript code from URL parameters.

## Best Practices Demonstrated

- Using `textContent` instead of `innerHTML`
- Implementing proper HTML escaping
- Input validation and sanitization
- Using proper input types
- Secure event handling
- Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations
- Safe handling of URL parameters in JavaScript
